            <h1>Spring Term Newsletter
                2019</h1>
            <p>Welcome back to everyone new and existing children! Some of you may be aware that sadly Buddies Pre-
                school
                closed its doors this month. Of course this is sad news but on a good note we have been able to
                accommodate
                some of their children. Along with children we have hired 3 new members of staff too! So welcome to Dee,
                Emma and Debbie.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Parking Permits</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Without our knowledge Wantz Rd became parking permit only. There are no signs along the road but the
                parking
                enforcer is ticketing. We have secured some permits from the local authority for those parents who have
                no
                choice but to drive. If you would like a permit please write a letter to Vikki, stating your child’s
                details
                and why you feel you may benefit from a parking permit. Parents will be informed of the outcome and
                where
                possible, permits will be issued.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Children in Nappies</h3>
            <br>
            <p>to the increase of children needing to be changed throughout the day we can no longer accept children who
                are wearing pull ups. From half
                term if children are not toilet training they should only wear nappies. Children wearing pull ups take
                much
                longer to change and this impacts on how much time staff spend changing children
            </p><br>
            <h3> Backpacks</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Can we please remind you that we do not have room for backpacks on the children’s pegs. Please use the
                clear
                bag provided on their pegs for their belongings.
            </p><br>
            <h3> Lunchboxes</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Please can you ensure all lunchboxes have at least 1to2 pieces of fruit everyday
            </p><br>
            <h3> Plimsolls</h3>
            <br>
            <p> As children like to take their shoes off, we are asking parents to provide a pair of black plimsolls
                that
                can stay here so children can change when they get to preschool. These must be clearly labelled with
                your
                child’s name.
            </p><br>
            <h3> Lateness upon collection</h3>
            <br>
            <p> A lateness fee will be applied each time a child is collected late from our
                setting. Picking children up late can be upsetting for some children and cause them to be unsettled. As
                well
                as this continual lateness must be reported to our Safeguarding Lead and needs to be recorded. Please
                can we
                ask if you are going to be late to ring ahead to let the staff know.
                Lateness fee structure After 3.05pm up to 3.20pm £5.00 Thereafter is £10, which will increase in £5
                increments every 10 minutes. This system will also apply to the 12pm pick up.</p>
